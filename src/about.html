        <p style="color: white">The GitPeek App is designed to provide quick information about any GitHub user. Simply enter a GitHub username to view user details, including followers, following, and top repositories. Created by Son Nguyen Hoang in 2023.</p>
        <p style="color: white">Because this app uses GitHub API, it is important to note that the app is limited to 60 requests per hour (based on IP address). So, if you exceed this limit, you will need to wait an hour before you can use the app again.</p>
